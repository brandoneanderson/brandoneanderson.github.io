        <h1>CARLS Eats Figma App prototype</h1>
        <h3>Project members: Brandon Ekow Anderson, Zubeyda Shute, Scott Gevurtz, Chloe Simanek  </h3>
        <p>Our goal is to prototype a Carleton food rating app that can be implemented to allow students to 
            easily capture images/descriptions of their food, rate dishes, and share this information with 
            fellow students. We want to help Carls get a better sense of what foods are available to them, 
            how those foods meet or don’t meet their dietary needs, and what comparable alternatives could 
            look like so that they do not have to worry about issues we have experienced in the dining halls 
            like undercooked chicken, food that is mislabeled for certain diets, and deceptive pricing on meal 
            plans. 
        </p>
        <div class="work-img">
             <img src="img/Carls_Eats.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"></a>
        </div>
        <p>The prototype here so far accomplishes the main goals/problems as stated earleir. With the camera feature, a student can capture a picture 
            of their food, or upload an already uploaded picture with ease. On the meal details page, the selected meal available for that day
            contains a description of the food, and image, as well as all the user reviews it has accumulated over time. In the future, a 
            feed will be umplemented below this informaiton to show the most recent reviews about that meal. 
        </p>

        <h3>Project Final Requirements: </h3>
        <p>My teams final 3 requirements for this page were:
           - Users shall be able to write and post detailed reviews for campus dining hall meals, provide feedback about the food, and their overall experience.
           - Users shall be able to filter and/or tag dining hall meal options and reviews based on food allergies and dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, halal, gluten-free, nut, dairy, soy) to accommodate personal needs.
           - Users shall be able to make reviews in optional formats; images, predetermined slider/star review/number system, or text input.
        </p>
        <div class="work-img">
            <img src="img/CARLS_Eats2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"></a>
       </div>
        <h3>How my prototype addresses each of the final three requirements: </h3>
        <p> - My prototype allows the users to write and post detailed reviews with the “New Post” page. They can write captions about the food, add tags to narrow down their selection and also give it a star rating per the first requirement.
            - My prototype allows the users to be able to filter/tag dining hall meal options and reviews based on their food allergies and dietary preferences. This filter can be applied when posting on the “New Post” page, and can be used to narrow down search/options on the “Feed Page” and the “Menu Page”
            - My prototype also allows the users to make reviews in three optional ways. These are through images, text/star reviews, and these can all be seen in the “New Post” page.

        <h3>Description of Team UX Research Process</h3>
        <p>Before my team progressed in improving our prototype, we first had to collect information from our stackholders/users. We spent a week drafting questions for a semi-interview protocol and a participatory design protocol, which we tested in class first with fellow students and made improvements from the feedback. 
            Once we finalized our interview protocol, we each split up to run the interview with selected students around campus, and asked for permission to record and use their recordings for our research. We used Otter.ai to transcribe the interview and make it easier to axial code, which I will talk about next.
        </p>

        <h3>Description of Team UX Analysis Process</h3>
        <p> After generating transcripts for our recorded interviews, we each read through each others transcriptions and made annotations to excerpts or phrases in the conversation that pertained to a phenomena, condition (causal, contextual or intervening), action and consequence in our project, which in this case is meal ratings, through a process called axial
            coding. Then, we each took all of our annotations and sorted them out on Figma Jam with sticky notes, a process called Affinity Diagram (<a href="https://www.figma.com/board/MmStn5D4upkNxeDRG5cZjq/Affinity-Diagramming?node-id=0-1&t=HXwG06mNCqy4lnOj-1"> <span class="hyperlink"> Here is the link to the Affinity Diagram </span></a>), and we developed a code book out of it. This code book was essential to solidifying our interpretations of the axial coding process we individually did, and keep all of our ideas on the same page.
            We finalized our code book by coming to a consensus and revised our axial codes once more with a paired partner in my team, for every other interview but our own.
        </p>

        <h3>How the UX research process has been implemented into my prototype</h3>
        <p> We were able to make requirements that our prototype should have with our consensus process, and these requirements were mentioned earlier. 
            Here is a video of how the requirements have been implemented, and each interaction flow fulfills those requirements
        </p>

        <h3>Interaction Flows</h3>
        <p> 1. Clicking the camera capture button, or the photo button will capture an image and send you to the "New Post" page for editting/reviewing. (Requirement 1).
        </p>
        <p> 2. The "New Post" page features options that you can include to your post; such as, images, tags, rating system and captions. Clicking post will post your review onto the "Feed Page" (Requirement 3).
        </p>
        <p> 3. On the "Menu" page, the user is able to click the options button on the top right of the title bar and open up filter options that the user can select to update their menu for personal needs. (Requirement 2).
        </p>
        <p> 4. The nav bar at the bottom will navigate to their corresponding pages
