        <h1>CARLS Eats Figma App prototype</h1>
        <h3>Project members: Brandon Ekow Anderson, Zubeyda Shute, Scott Gevurtz, Chloe Simanek  </h3>
        <p>Our goal is to prototype a Carleton food rating app that can be implemented to allow students to 
            easily capture images/descriptions of their food, rate dishes, and share this information with 
            fellow students. We want to help Carls get a better sense of what foods are available to them, 
            how those foods meet or donâ€™t meet their dietary needs, and what comparable alternatives could 
            look like so that they do not have to worry about issues we have experienced in the dining halls 
            like undercooked chicken, food that is mislabeled for certain diets, and deceptive pricing on meal 
            plans. 
        </p>

             <img src="img/Carls_Eats.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"></a>
        </div>
        <p>The prototype here so far accomplishes the main goals/problems as stated earleir. With the camera feature, a student can capture a picture 
            of their food, or upload an already uploaded picture with ease. On the meal details page, the selected meal available for that day
            contains a description of the food, and image, as well as all the user reviews it has accumulated over time. In the future, a 
            feed will be umplemented below this informaiton to show the most recent reviews about that meal.
